       "  AIMessage(content='Here’s a concise briefing on all three topics you asked about, with quick summaries and pointers to source material.\\n\\n1) What is LangGraph?\\n\\n- LangGraph is a library within the LangChain ecosystem designed to define, coordinate, and execute complex AI workflows that involve multiple LLM agents or chained steps.\\n- It treats a workflow as a graph of nodes (steps) and edges (data/control flow), enabling memory, branching, and feedback loops. This makes it easier to build multi-agent systems or sophisticated AI pipelines without managing all the orchestration logic by hand.\\n- Common use cases include chatbots with multiple capabilities, autonomous agents, or any scenario requiring structured, reusable agent interactions and state management.\\n\\nKey points from multiple explanations:\\n- LangGraph provides a structured framework for managing state and coordinating interactions among several agents or chains.\\n- It’s often described as an extension to LangChain for more complex, graph-based AI workflows.\\n\\nSources (overview and definitions you can check):\\n- LangGraph Tutorial: DataCamp\\n- What is LangGraph?: GeeksforGeeks\\n- Introduction to LangGraph: Medium\\n- How to Use LangChain and LangGraph: FreeCodeCamp\\n- What is LangGraph?: Analytics Vidhya\\n\\n2) Rent prices in Bangalore (1 BHK)\\n\\nRents vary widely by locality, building type, and amenities. Based on current listings and market summaries, here is a synthesized snapshot:\\n\\n- Typical 1 BHK rent range in many mid-range localities: approximately INR 12,000 to INR 25,000 per month.\\n- Examples from listings:\\n  - BTM Layout: around INR 15,000–16,000 per month (1 BHK)\\n  - Average 1 BHK rent (overall Bangalore): around INR 19,500–19,550 per month (as reported by several housing portals)\\n  - Broader ranges (including premium areas): INR 18,000 to INR 35,000+ per month in some neighborhoods\\n- Disposal of data points (illustrative only, varies by locality):\\n  - 99acres: 1 BHK in various parts of Bangalore often around 15k/month\\n  - Square Yards: 1 BHK listings around 16k/month in certain layouts\\n  - Housing.com: average around ~19.5k/month\\n  - MagicBricks/KOTS: widely variable ranges, with some listings as low as ~10k and some premium areas well above 25k–35k\\n\\nPrivate note: This is a market snapshot; exact rents depend on neighborhood (e.g., electronic city, JP Nagar, Koramangala, BTM, Whitefield, etc.), building age, furnished/unfurnished status, and facilities (parking, elevators, security, etc.). If you want, I can fetch live current listings for specific neighborhoods you’re considering and give you a tighter shortlist.\\n\\n3) Latest political news on India–US relations\\n\\nThe India–US relationship in 2025 has been active, with both high-level engagement and some frictions around trade. Here’s a brief digest of the most recent developments from multiple sources:\\n\\n- April 2025: High-level engagement in Washington\\n  - Indian and U.S. officials met in Washington; reports indicate progress in bilateral trade agreement talks.\\n  - The Embassy of India in Washington noted positive movement on bilateral trade discussions and hosted a meeting involving senior officials and the U.S. Vice President, signaling continued high-level engagement.\\n- Mid to late 2025: Frictions and trade discussions\\n  - There are reports of tariff-related tensions, including discussions around tariffs proposed under the Trump-era approach and how they would affect India.\\n  - Coverage suggests ongoing, sometimes tense, negotiations around a broader trade framework, but with continued dialogue at senior levels.\\n- Late 2025: Analysts’ takes and outlook\\n  - Several outlets suggested that while the relationship faces bumps (tariffs, trade issues), the strategic partnership remains robust, with expectations that the partnership could endure and potentially thrive despite short-term frictions.\\n  - Observers note the importance of continued diplomacy and diversified engagement to manage disagreements.\\n\\nRepresentative sources you can consult for the latest wording and specifics:\\n- India–US relations analysis and notes (academic/think-tank perspectives, 2025)\\n- South China Morning Post coverage on US–India relations (updates in 2025)\\n- Embassy of India, Washington, latest news/press releases (April 2025)\\n- The Diplomat (op-ed/analysis on India–US partnership in 2025)\\n\\nIf you’d like, I can pull the absolute latest headlines from a live feed and summarize them in a short briefing with dates and key takeaways, or focus on a particular aspect (e.g., trade talks, defense/strategic cooperation, visa policies, or high-level visits).\\n\\nWould you like me to:\\n- fetch current, live headlines on India–US relations with a concise briefing and links, and/or\\n- pull up current Bangalore 1 BHK listings for a few specific neighborhoods you’re considering?', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 2576, 'prompt_tokens': 7331, 'total_tokens': 9907, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 1536, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 4480}}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'id': 'chatcmpl-CbHiKzWqaeAsnjV4dhD8mesNOPBSp', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='lc_run--ef54e9cb-b4c4-4c86-9578-b83ba3c6b64e-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 7331, 'output_tokens': 2576, 'total_tokens': 9907, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 4480}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 1536}})]}"
